    Project for MSCH-C220 
    9/27/24
      Arcade shooter with angels and demons instead. 
      
  ## Implementation 
  Created using [Unity 2022.3.45f](https://unity.com)

  I drew three backgrounds, one for the menu, one for the scene, one for the end part. I drew the demons to replace the asteroids, I drew an angel to replace the ship, I drew the two bullets to make them better themed, I drew a 19 frame fire animation, and I replaced the enemy with a ball of bright fire which I drew.
